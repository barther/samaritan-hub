# Beta Testing Quick Reference

## When Something Goes Wrong

### 🚨 SYSTEM IS BROKEN (Can't work at all)
**DO THIS IMMEDIATELY:**
1. Take a photo of the screen
2. Note the exact time
3. Call/text: _________________ 
4. Write down what you were doing
5. Try refreshing the page once

### ⚠️ SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT (Can still work)
**DO THIS WHEN YOU HAVE TIME:**
1. Fill out a bug report
2. Try the same thing again
3. See if there's another way to do it
4. Make a note to discuss later

### 💡 IDEA FOR IMPROVEMENT
**DO THIS:**
1. Write it down immediately
2. Include why it would help
3. Add to weekly feedback

## What Makes a Good Bug Report?

### ✅ HELPFUL
- "I was adding a new client, clicked Save, got an error message that said 'Invalid phone number' but I entered 770-555-1234 which should be correct"
- "When I try to print the monthly report, only the first page prints and the rest is blank"

### ❌ NOT HELPFUL  
- "It's broken"
- "The system doesn't work"
- "I clicked something and it didn't do what I wanted"

## Testing Priorities (Do These First)

### Week 1: Survival Skills
1. Can you log in reliably?
2. Can you add a client?
3. Can you find a client?
4. Can you record an interaction?

### Week 2: Daily Operations  
1. Can you process a typical assistance request?
2. Can you record donations?
3. Can you generate basic reports?
4. Does the fund balance stay accurate?

### Week 3: Edge Cases
1. What happens with duplicate clients?
2. Can you handle complex assistance requests?
3. Do mobile/tablet versions work?
4. Can you export data for grants?

## Red Flags (Call Immediately)
- Money amounts are wrong
- Client information gets mixed up
- Can't log in at all
- System shows someone else's data
- Payments go to wrong people
- Reports show incorrect totals

## Green Flags (Working Well)
- Tasks feel faster than before
- Information is easy to find
- Reports are more accurate
- Less paperwork to manage
- Fewer phone calls asking for status

## Questions to Ask Yourself Daily
1. **Efficiency**: "Is this faster than the old way?"
2. **Accuracy**: "Is the information correct?"
3. **Clarity**: "Do I understand what's happening?"
4. **Confidence**: "Do I trust this system with our data?"

## Remember
- **You're the expert** on how this job should work
- **Finding problems is good** - that's why we're testing
- **No question is stupid** - if it confuses you, it needs fixing
- **Document everything** - details help fix issues faster

## Emergency Contacts
**System Issues**: _________________
**Training Questions**: _________________

## Backup Plans
**If system is down:**
- Use paper forms (in filing cabinet)
- Enter data when system returns
- Call IT contact if down > 2 hours

**If unsure about data:**
- Don't guess - ask for help
- Save your work frequently
- Keep notes in case you need to recreate
